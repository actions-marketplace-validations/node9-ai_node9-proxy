// STAGE 6, STEP 6: THE TRIVIALLY RESOLVABLE SUBSTITUTION (JAIL-14, half two)
//
// `cat $(echo ~/.ssh/id_rsa)` was ALLOW. A CmdSubst is dynamic to the resolver,
// so the word occupied no slot, and the regex twin that would have caught the
// text was suppressed by astSuppressed(). The design's first answer was to
// narrow that suppression. Its own corpus rejected it: the narrowed twin would
// have blocked 15 of 25 legitimate commands (`grep -rn "\.ssh/" $DIR`,
// `cat $TEMPLATE | envsubst > .env`, `jq .env $(ls *.json)`) and still missed 7
// of 19 attacks, because the regex is unanchored across segments and reads a
// PATTERN operand as a path. That is the trade stage 1 already refused.
//
// What replaces it: `$(echo X)`, `` `echo X` `` and `$(printf '%s' X)` with a
// literal X are not unknowable. They ARE X. The resolver contributes X, every
// tier inherits it exactly as `$HOME` became `~`, and no regex is involved, so
// none of the fifteen false positives can occur. A substitution whose body is
// anything else (`$(find ...)`, `$(cat /tmp/p)`, two statements, a redirect)
// stays dynamic and belongs to the evalDynamic knob, as before.
//
// Direction of a mistake: resolving a substitution can only ADD a judged word.
// A wrong resolution is a false positive; an unresolved one is today's
// behaviour. Design: doc/jail-stage6-open-gaps-design.md, 3.11.
