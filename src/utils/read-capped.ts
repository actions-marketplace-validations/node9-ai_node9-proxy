/**
 * Read at most `maxBytes` from `file`, with the cap enforced by the read rather
 * than by a prior `statSync`.
 *
 * The pattern this replaces is:
 *
 *     const stat = fs.statSync(file);
 *     if (stat.size > CAP) return null;   // guard
 *     return fs.readFileSync(file);       // unbounded
 *
 * The guard reads one file and the read reads whatever the path points at by
 * then, so swapping the file in between defeats exactly the limit the guard
 * exists to impose (CodeQL js/file-system-race). `posture` walks paths the user
 * does not own, which is where that matters most.
 *
 * The size here comes from `fstat` on the already-open descriptor, not from
 * `stat` on the path. A descriptor is bound to the inode it opened, so nothing
 * that happens to the path afterwards can change what it describes. That also
 * keeps the allocation proportional to the file instead of to the cap, which
 * matters when a caller passes a large budget (skill-pin allows 50 MB in
 * total, and allocating that per file would be absurd).
 *
 * Returns null when the path cannot be opened or is not a regular file.
