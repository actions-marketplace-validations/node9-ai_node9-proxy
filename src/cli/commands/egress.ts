// src/cli/commands/egress.ts
// Registered as `node9 egress` by cli.ts. The remediation on-ramp for the
// posture report's "Egress open" finding: a one-command way to turn on egress
// control (a policy, not a shield) and manage the allowlist.
//
// Routine traffic (LLM APIs, package registries, localhost) is allowed by the
// engine's DEFAULT_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST, so turning egress on doesn't break a
// normal agent — only genuinely-unknown hosts get prompted (watch) or blocked
// (lock). See doc/roadmap/active/posture-egress-onramp-design.md.

/**
 * The SSRF floor, stated before the allow/deny lists: strongest first. Until
 * this block existed the floor blocked and no screen said it was there, so a
 * user only met it as a surprise at the moment of a block.
 *
 * Every line here was rewritten after a code review found three overclaims:
 * the floor only sees SHELL commands (a WebFetch or an MCP fetch tool reaches
 * the address unchecked), CGNAT is blocked by default and was named nowhere,
 * and `node9 pause` lifts the floor along with everything else. A status
 * screen that overstates protection is worse than none.
 *
 * Corrected again 2026-09-21, and this time the text was UNDERstating. Two of
 * those three claims stopped being true the same day they were written:
 *   - `438cd16` (the same date) taught the floor to read a declared URL, so
 *     WebFetch and the MCP fetch tools DO pass it. Measured: WebFetch to the
 *     metadata endpoint is denied.
 *   - CGNAT is NOT in the always-blocked set. It is `hit('cgnat', true)`,
 *     i.e. overridable, and it sits in STRICT_TIERS, i.e. reachable until
 *     `ssrfStrict` is on. Measured: `curl http://100.64.0.5/` is allowed on a
 *     default install, and an exemption releases it.
 * The same two errors were live on four surfaces at once (this one, the MCP
 * tool, the posture row, the dashboard caption), because the fix that made
 * them wrong never came back to the text. A claim that lives in four places
 * needs one wording; this is it, and the other three quote it.
 *
 * The exemption list printed is the EFFECTIVE one (getConfig has already
 * dropped an entry that names a protected address), so a user who typed one
 * sees that it is not in force.
